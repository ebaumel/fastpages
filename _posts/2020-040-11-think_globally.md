# Think globally, act locally

This expression originated in urban planning and environmentalism, but is can be applied broadly in many diciplines including business, politics and computer science.

I like to think it also can be viewed with regards to our conduct towards our own family and our personal inner lives.

Charity begins at home, both in being charitable in thoughts and deeds to those closest to us, and in caring for ourselves.

*Be kind to each other, and be kind to yourself.*
